    <h2>Chef's Notes:</h2>
    <p>This recipe can be made with 4 cups of chicken stock or 6.  Four cups will yield a very hearty thick soup. Six cups will yield a thinner soup.  I prefer the four cup version. The nutritional information is for the recipe as written.Please note that the soup you see being ladled in the video is made with six cups.</p>
