    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Texas Chili is a classic spicy bean-free chili known as “Bowl o’ Red” that’s smoky, beefy and full of flavor. Perfect for game day, cookouts and crockpots!</p>
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 yellow onions, diced</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ancho chile powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cumin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>29 ounces diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>6 ounces tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add vegetable oil and onions to a large dutch oven on medium heat and cook until the onions are translucent, about 6-8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, and cook for 1 minute stirring well.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef, breaking apart as you cook it for 6-8 minutes but leave the chunks a bit larger, and allow the beef to sear well.</li>
        <li>Add in the salt, ancho chile powder, cumin, paprika and brown sugar and stir well, cooking for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add in the diced tomatoes, and tomato paste and whisk well until the tomato paste is well mixed in.</li>
        <li>Add in the beef broth and bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium low and cook for 1 hour, stirring every fifteen minutes.</li>
        <li>Chili is done when the beef broth is reduced to the right consistency where the ground beef is not lost in the gravy.</li>
    </ol>
