learning my front-end foundations, this is my html project

This is a very basic, bare bones website. The project was to build a basic recipe website. I ended up choosing all soups! So apparently this is my soup website. Besides getting to practice HTML elements and tags, and getting the feel of building a HTML project, this is also the first project I've done while actively using git.
